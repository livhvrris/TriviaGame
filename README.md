# TriviaGame

# You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
# If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
# The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
# If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
# If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
# On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

PSEUDO CODE:

Each question is set to display for a specific amount of time.
If the time runs out or an answer (button) is selected, the next questions will appear and begin it's own timer.
There will be 2 button that represent the answer for each question.
If the question is answered correctly, this will be logged as a correct answer (and vice versa for incorrect answers).
